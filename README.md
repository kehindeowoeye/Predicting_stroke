# Datasets
Dataset has been downloaded here from the UCI repository



# Training and Testing
Clone or download this repository into. Python stroke.py trains and test four models described in the report whilst displaying their respective accuracies and F1 scores. 



# Influential features
Python stroke_important_features.py will generate the figure 'mutualinfo.eps' showing the mutual information between  the features and the predicted attribute. This is dependent on the library mixed.py which is here but can be copied from the repository in the paper cited.
